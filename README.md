# ZRE Car Config 
ZRE Car Config is a desktop application for the configuration, monitoring, and debugging of ZRE race cars. As a desktop app, it can serve dual-purpose as a debugging tool for test-bench vehicle electronics and for configuration / monitoring of the vehicle during testing and competition.

It is designed to eventually replace the large touchscreen dashboard, allowing us to keep our easy configuration capabilities while saving weight, reducing the LV battery size, and giving more room for steering wheel position flexibility.

This software is written in python and is based off of code from DASH23. Layout is inspired by the BMSGuiApplication.

# Connecting to the Vehicle
There will be two ways to connect Car Config to the race car:
- USB to CAN Adapter
- Bluetooth

# Installation

### Dependencies
Car-Config uses customtkinter, which needs to be installed in addition to tkinter configured python. First make sure python is installed by checking the python version:
'python3 -version'

 and that pip is up to date:
'pip3 install --upgrade pip'

Sometimes 'packaging' isn't installed:
'pip3 install packaging'

Finally install tkinter and customtkinter:
'pip3 install python-tk'
'pip3 install customtkinter'
